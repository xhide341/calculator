## About

This project is about a basic calculator that emphasizes on UI/UX design. It offers a light/dark mode option for users and is only a mini-project for my coding journey towards web development.

### Features

Here is a short summary for what the calculator does:

- This calculator can add, subtract, multiply, divide, along with percent conversion and negation.
- This calculator only has a limit of 10 digit calculation since anything above that leads to the need of scientific notations to fit.
- This calculator offers light/dark mode toggle with the theme played around with light and dark blue colors.

## What I Learned

I learned about the creation of a class inside a javascript file to operate the different functionalities of the button. I also learned the importance of naming semantics since things got more complex and cluttered along the process. 

For the functionalities, I learned that brainstorming a pseudocode is crucial since it gives me the visualization of what to prioritize and what problem to break down first. 

Moreover, I utilized the generative AIs to talk about and understand what they consider the most efficient and clean methods to use -- to which I am very grateful for.
